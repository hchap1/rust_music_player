viva la vida
numb
what ive done
brothers in arms
this love
zombie
shadow of the day
leave out all the rest
les boys
hand in hand
solid rock
expresso love
skateaway
sultans of swing
daughter
magic
always in my head
midnight
the scientist
parachutes
yellow
something just like this
castle of glass
numb
session
from the inside
breaking the habit
figure.09
faint
easier to run
hit the floor
lying from you
somewhere i belong
dont stay
in the end
one step closer
warning sign
death and all his friends
thunderstruck
untitled how could this happen to me
pumped up kicks
enter sandman
on melancholy hill
black hole sun
broken wings
mad world
wheel in the sky
i just died in your arms
shout
rosanna
africa
adventure of a lifetime
november rain
paradise city
take me to church
rocket man
the pretender
great southern land
even flow
fix you
sky full of stars
money for nothing
wherever i may roam
sad but true
nothing else matters
